#### Who am I?
Hi, I'm Lin. I'm a life scientist by training, now transitioning into the world of programming and data science. This blog is an account of this process, and also hopefully a resource for others who are thinking of doing the same.

#### What was I doing before?
I have just completed a PhD at the University of Cambridge in molecular genetics. I was studying [plant evolution.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin_Taylor) Before my PhD, I spent a year working as a data analyst and researcher at the Royal Botanic Gardens in London.

#### What else?
I love learning about the natural world (especially plants). I also love cooking, eating, and making things. My favourite animal is the giant panda.
