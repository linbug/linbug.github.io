####Who am I?
Hi, I'm Lin. I'm a life scientist by training, now transitioning into the world of data science. This blog is an account of this process, and also hopefully a resource for others who are thinking of doing the same. 

####What was I doing before?
I am just in the process of completing a PhD from the University of Cambridge in molecular genetics. I was studying [plant evolution.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin_Taylor) Before my PhD, I spent a year working as a data analyst and researcher at the Royal Botanic Gardens in London. 

####Why data science?
There are several reasons why I'm starting down this road:

- **I want to learn skills that are highly transferrable and in high demand.** There is a huge and growing demand for people who can code, do statistics, and use technology to gain insight from data, and crucially can communicate these findings. Even within my own discipline in the life sciences, it's been difficult to ignore the growing need for people who can analyse and make sense of large datasets such as gene expression data from microarrays, genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data, and .... These sorts of skills are likely to become an even more valuable skill in the future. There is also an incredible wealth of [learning resources online](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IDNSt0ckSuv5Sw67cw17fJDuOELGa-pjCSR2vuWK8OA/edit?usp=sharing), and these are being added to all the time. So it seems like the right time to get involved in this space.

- **There is the possibility to making a large and positive impact on the world**. Much of the hype surrounding data science seems to be about predicting the success of [Netflix series'](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/for-house-of-cards-using-big-data-to-guarantee-its-popularity.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), or making [personalised shopping recommendations]() .... However, I'm more interested in how the power of data can be harnessed for socially-motivated causes. For example, organisations like [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/) use data science to help non-profits to become more effective. Data science is also being used in clinical settings to Healthcare companies ... This feeds into the Effective Altruism movement (exemplified by organisations such as [the Centre for Effective Altruism](https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/), [80,000 hours](http://80000hours.org/), and [Give Well](http://www.givewell.org/)),  which seeks to use evidence-based analysis to help others as much as possible. I want to participate in leveraging these technologies to make large, positive impacts for human welfare.

- **It's fun!** Data science combines aspects of science, problem-solving, programming and storytelling, all things that I enjoy. I also really like learning new things, a useful quality in an industry where new technologies are being created all the time. Finally, data science is a broad industry at the moment, so I'm optimistic that there is space for me to carve out a niche for myself that fits by skills and aspirations. 
 
####What else?
I love learning about the natural world (especially [plants](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin_Taylor)), and our place in the universe. I am excited about what humanity will discover in the next 10-50 years. I also love cooking, eating, and making things. My favourite animal is the giant panda.
