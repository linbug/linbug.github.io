#### Who am I?
Hi, I'm Lin. I'm a life scientist by training,  now working in data science. This blog is an account of that transition and what happened afterwards.

#### What was I doing before?
Since my PhD, I attended [S2DS](http://www.s2ds.org/), the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/), and an internship at [Enthought](https://www.enthought.com/). Now I work as a Data Scientist at [DueDil](https://www.duedil.com/about).

#### What else?
I love learning about the natural world (especially plants). I also love cooking, eating, and making things. My favourite animal is the giant panda.
