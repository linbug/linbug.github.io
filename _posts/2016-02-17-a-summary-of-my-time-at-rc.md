title: A summary of my time at RC
layout: post
---

[RC](https://www.recurse.com/) is over for me, or at least the in-person component (RC-ers never graduate, remember?). This post is a reflection of the things that I learned there, as well as my highlights and lowlights of the past 3 months.

**tl;dr: had a great time, learned a lot. If you want to get better at programming and also meet a whole lot of smart, passionate people who will help you do it, RC is the place.**

# Things I learned

I gained a heap of object-level knowledge:

- I learned a lot more about Python, including decorators and generators and pickles, and I finally got to grips with classes by working on multiple projects
- I learned about common computer science data structures and algorithms at workshops organised by [Pauli](https://github.com/marfarma) and [Javier](http://www.jvrpath.com/); I coded some of these up during whiteboarding sessions
- I learned how to use [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to make Web applications
- I learned how to use [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to make interactive visualisations
- I learned about test driven development, and the modules for this in Python
- I played around with web scraping in [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)
- I read a lot about modelling linear regressions in [Gelman and Hill](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/), and practiced these in R
- I learned about relational databases, and using them to store and query georeferenced data
- I learned  how to use the [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) library to scrape Twitter data
- I had my first taste of AWS (specifically RDS for serving a database, and S3 for storing data). It was prohibitively complex for a beginner.
- I learned how to quickly knock together a web page with HTML/CSS/Javascript and style it so it looks pretty
- I learned such things as [Monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)) exist... but I still don't understand what they are :D

I also learned less tangible stuff:

- I gained confidence in my programming ability, and gained a greater understanding of where I fit in the programming ability spectrum
- I learned to enjoy whiteboarding! I went from 'I am terrified I can't even write' to 'this is fun, let's do another one!'
- I greatly broadened my knowledge of the programming ecosystem by seeing what kinds of projects other people were working on
- I updated my expectations for how much I can hope to achieve in a certain amount of time. I seem to achieve less than I think I will on a given day but learn faster than I expect to over successive days/weeks

#The best bits

Here's my RC highlights reel:

- Making [Planigale](http://planigale.dvndrsn.com/) with [Dave](http://dvndrsn.com/), and getting featured on [Jerry Coyne's blog](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2016/01/11/a-fun-and-educational-wildlife-quiz/)
- Running around Manhattan on NYE with [Shad](https://github.com/Shadhopson), Andrew, [Diego](http://cestdiego.github.io/) and [Darius](http://wry.me/)
- Having other people be excited about stuff I made
- Playing in the snow with [Ezekiel](http://www.tehgeekmeister.com/)
- Experiencing the slow seeping of understanding about functional programming principles
- Friday night talks, and the amazing projects people had made. A few of my favourites were Javier's [pixelarttoCSS](http://pixelart-to-css-react.herokuapp.com/), Carrie's [painting colour theory ML](http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Monet.html) and Jesse's [Fourier transformations](https://github.com/jtgonz/fourier-sketchpad)
- Singing bad songs at karaoke
- Defusing [virtual bombs](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/) with multiple people.
- Everyone's excitement when [Allie](http://alliejon.es/) brought in her Arduino-hacked knitting machine
- Making origami cranes over Christmas
- Getting Chinese food, and Peruvian food, and Malaysian food, and Mexican food, and ...

# The not so best bits

For balance, here's my RC bloopers reel:

- Spending ~30 days (really, I checked my notes) at the start of my batch being confused about what to work on
- Spending way too long worrying about housing for the second half of my batch
- Getting a cold and RSI in my last week so that I effectively stopped typing
- The days when I felt like I didn't move forward with my project
- Feeling project envy when everyone else seemed to be making awesome stuff

This post has turned into a list splurge. I will just finish up by saying, I am very glad that I made the decision to come to RC. I can't think how long it would have taken me to learn or encounter such things, or met such a community, had I not done so.
