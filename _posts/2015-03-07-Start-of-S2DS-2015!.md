Yesterday [S2DS 2015]({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.s2ds.org/"}}{\fldrslt http://www.s2ds.org/}}) officially kicked off!  Over the next five weeks, I and a cohort of about 80 other PhD students and postdocs will be immersed in the world of data science. For a couple of weeks, S2DS will put on lectures about coding, big data and statistics, but the majority of our time here will be spent working on a real data science project with a company sponsor. This hands-on component was what really drew me to this scheme; it\'92ll be my first experience of working on a real commercial data science project. This project will likely be more involved than any I\'92ve done before (it spans multiple weeks, and I expect to be using techniques that are new to me), and for the first time I\'92ll also be working within a team of two other scientists. I expect the reality of this - the things that I\'92ll find challenging and what it will really be like managing a data science project - will be quite different from what I predict at this point. I\'92m looking forward to finding out what those differences are. \

Yesterday we had a full day of introductions, lectures about good coding practices and meetings with our company mentors, all rounded off with a great welcome dinner in Euston square. Here\'92s a picture of my team mate David enjoying a white wine on the roof deck:\

At the end of the evening, we had a silly competition to find out which team could make the most creative lego sculpture. Unfortunately, our lego fire-breathing dragon did not garner adequate favour to claim victory:\

So far, I\'92ve really enjoyed meeting such a friendly and smart bunch of people. I\'92m excited for what the next few weeks have in store! }
