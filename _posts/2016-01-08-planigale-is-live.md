***UBER VICTORY POINTS UPDATE 11/1/2016***: **Planigale was featured on [Jerry Coyne's blog!!](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2016/01/11/a-fun-and-educational-wildlife-quiz/)**

[Dave](http://dvndrsn.com/) and I finally got [Planigale](http://planigale.dvndrsn.com/) up and running!

We also have [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) so we can see statistics about visitors to our site. Here's the breakdown of sessions played since we went live on Wednesday:

You can also see where in the world people are playing! Creepy.

I especially like the breakdown by city:

I can tell I'm going to have a lot of fun with this.
